This is a blog post about python and what I have learned in class. Specifically, I thought that regular expressions were really interesting, and I thought that I would share the examples that we learned here.

Regular expressions (Regex) allows you to extract specific information by searching for a match that defines a pattern. I think this is very useful, and it was also cool to learn about!

Here are some of the common regex symbols and their meanings that we learned:

Here is a simple example of regex from my homework assignment:

```{R}
library(reticulate)
```

```{python}
import re
string1="We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\',\' is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task... we are joking"
print(string1)
re.findall(r"\d+",string1)
```

The code shows an example of regular expressions as it was able to find all of the numbers using "d", 1 or more times with the + sign from string1. This is a useful trick when you want to tidy up or find specific data!

Here is another example that is more complicated:

```{python}
string3=r"Fedora Core ftp \
Fedora Extras http ftp rsync\
ftp://ftp7.br.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp)\
ftp://ftp3.de.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp)\
ftp://ftp.is.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp / rsync)\
ftp://ftp4.jp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp)\
ftp://ftp.no.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp / rsync)\
*\
ftp://ftp3.no.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp)\
ftp://ftp.pt.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp)\
ftp://ftp1.ro.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp / ftpv6)\
ftp://ftp3.es.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp)\
ftp://ftp2.tw.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp / ftpv6 / http / httpv6 / rsync / rsyncv6)\
ftp://ftp6.uk.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp)\
ftp://ftp6.us.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/ (ftp / http)"
re.findall(r"ftp://\S*/FreeBSD/",string3)
```
This code finds a match for the pattern after ftp:// and before /FreeBSD/ that is non-whitespace, specified by "S", and 0 or more times specified by *. 

There are many other ways to use regex as well, as this blog post is just a small snippet of what we have learned with python!
